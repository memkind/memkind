 *  The pmem memory memkind operations enable memory kinds built on memory-mapped
 *  files. These support traditional volatile memory allocation in a fashion
 *  similar to libvmem(3) library. It uses the mmap(2) system call to create
 *  a pool of volatile memory. Such memory may have different attributes,
 *  depending on the file system containing the memory-mapped files. (See also
 *  http://pmem.io/pmdk/libvmem).
 *
 *  The pmem memkinds are most useful when used with Direct Access storage (DAX),
 *  which is memory-addressable persistent storage that supports load/store access
 *  without being paged via the system page cache. A Persistent Memory-aware file
 *  system is typically used to provide this type of access.
 *
 *  The most convenient way to create pmem memkinds is to use memkind_create_pmem()
 *  (see memkind(3)).

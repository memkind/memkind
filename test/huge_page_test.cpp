/*
 * This test was created because of the munmap() fail in jemalloc.
 * There are two root causes of the error:
 * - kernel bug (munmap() fails when the size is not aligned)
 * - heap Manager doesnâ€™t provide size aligned to 2MB pages for munmap()
 * Test allocates 2000MB using Huge Pages
 * (50threads*10operations*4MBalloc_size), but it needs extra Huge Pages due to
 * overhead caused by heap management.

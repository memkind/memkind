/*
* This test was created because of the munmap() fail in jemalloc.
* There are two root causes of the error:
* - kernel bug (munmap() fails when the size is not aligned)
* - heap Manager doesnâ€™t provide size aligned to 2MB pages for munmap()
* Test allocates 2000MB using Huge Pages (50threads*10operations*4MBalloc_size),
* but it needs extra Huge Pages due to overhead caused by heap management.

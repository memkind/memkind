.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR hbw_check_available ()
returns 0 if high bandwidth memory is available and an error code
described in the
.B ERRORS
section if not.
.PP
.BR hbw_malloc ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of uninitialized high bandwidth memory. The allocated space is
suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion) for storage of any
type of object. If
.I size
is zero then
.BR hbw_malloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR hbw_calloc ()
allocates space for
.I nmemb
objects in high bandwidth memory, each
.I size
bytes in length. The result is identical to calling
.BR hbw_malloc ()
with an argument of
.IR nmemb * size
, with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly
initialized to zero bytes.  If
.I nmemb
or
.I size
is 0, then
.BR hbw_calloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR hbw_realloc ()
changes the size of the previously allocated high bandwidth memory
referenced by
.I ptr
to
.I size
bytes. The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of
the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the contents of the
newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined. Upon success, the
memory referenced by
.I ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated high bandwidth memory is
returned.

.BR Note:
.BR hbw_realloc ()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value
than
.IR "ptr" .

If
.I ptr
is NULL, the
.BR hbw_realloc ()
function behaves identically to
.BR hbw_malloc ()
for the specified size.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, was returned by a previous call to
.BR hbw_malloc (),
.BR hbw_calloc (),
.BR hbw_realloc (),
.BR hbw_posix_memalign (),
or
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ().
Otherwise, or if
.I hbw_free(ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR hbw_free ()
causes the allocated high bandwidth memory referenced by
.I ptr
to be made available for future allocations. If
.I ptr
is NULL, no action occurs.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR hbw_malloc (),
.BR hbw_calloc (),
.BR hbw_realloc (),
.BR hbw_posix_memalign (),
or
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ().
Otherwise, if
.I hbw_free(ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR hbw_posix_memalign ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of high bandwidth memory such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
.PP
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of high bandwidth memory such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
The memory will be allocated using pages determined by the
.IR "psize"
variable which may be one of the following enumerated values:
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_4KB
The four kilobyte page size option. Note that with transparent huge
pages enabled these allocations may be promoted by the operating
system to two megabyte pages.
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_2MB
The two megabyte page size option.
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_1GB
This option allows the user to specify arbitrary sizes backed by
one gigabytes pages.
.TP
.B HBW_PAGESIZE_1GB_STRICT
The one gigabyte page size option. The total size of the allocation
must be a multiple of 1GB with this option, otherwise the allocation
will fail.
.PP
.BR hbw_get_policy ()
returns the current fallback policy when insufficient high bandwith
memory is available.
.PP
.BR hbw_set_policy ()
set the current fallback policy, the policy can be modified only once
in the life of an application. The policy in effect at the time when a
buffer is allocated determines the policy for that buffer until it is
freed.
.TP
.B HBW_POLICY_BIND
If insufficient high bandwidth memory is available to satisfy
a request, the allocated pointer is set to NULL and
.I errno
is set to ENOMEM.
.TP
.B HBW_POLICY_PREFERRED
If insufficient high bandwidth memory is available, fall back to
standard memory (default).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR hbw_get_policy ()
returns
.B HBW_POLICY_BIND
or
.B HBW_POLICY_PREFERRED
which represents the current high bandwidth policy.
.BR hbw_set_policy ()
and
.BR hbw_free ()
do not have return values.
.BR hbw_malloc ()
.BR hbw_calloc ()
and
.BR hbw_realloc ()
return the pointer to the allocated memory, or NULL if the request
fails.
.BR hbw_posix_memalign ()
and
.BR hbw_posix_memalign_psize ()
return zero on success and return an error code
as described in the
.B ERRORS
section below on failure.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.BR hbw_check_available ()
returns one of the error codes described in
.BR memkind (3)
if high bandwidth memory is not available.
.TP
.BR "hbw_posix_memalign" "() and " "hbw_posix_memalign_psize" "()"
return the one of the POSIX standard error codes
.B EINVAL
or
.B ENOMEM
as defined in
.IR <errno.h>
if an error occurs.
If the
.I alignment
parameter is not a power of two, or was not a multiple of
.IR "sizoeof(void *)" ,
then
.B EINVAL
is returned.  If there was insufficient memory to satisfy the request then
.B ENOMEM
is returned.
.SH "NOTES"
The
.I hbwmalloc.h
file defines the external functions and enumerations for the hbwmalloc
library. These interfaces define a heap manager that targets high
bandwidth memory numa nodes.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I /etc/memkind/node-bandwidth
File that contains the bandwidth values for each numa node.
.TP
.I /etc/rc/d/init.d/memkind
Initialization script that creates the node-bandwidth file by calling
the PMTT table parser.
.TP
.I /usr/sbin/memkind-pmtt
The PMTT table parser.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
This environment varaible is a comma separated list of NUMA nodes that
are treated as high bandwidth. This environment variable should be set
if the PMTT file is not present, or to override the PMTT table if it
is present. Uses the
.I libnuma
routine
.BR numa_parse_nodestring ()
for parsing, so the syntax described in the
.BR numa (3)
man page for this routine applies for example: 1-3,5 is a valid setting.

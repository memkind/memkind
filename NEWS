OPEN DEVELOPMENT
================

We are moving to a more open development model with memkind.

- The memkind github organization:
  https://github.com/memkind

- Rather than posting bulk patches at time of tag, we are posting more
  incremental patches with finer grain commit details.

- There is now a "dev" branch in the memkind repository and a
  "memkind-dev" branch in the memkind fork of the jemalloc repository.
  These will be used for open development work.

- There is a memkind web page here:
  http://memkind.github.io/memkind

- We have posted an architecture document here:
  http://memkind.github.io/memkind/memkind_arch_20150318.pdf

- We invite you to join the memkind mailing list:
  https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/memkind

- Feel free to open a github issue, especially if there is a TODO item
  that you would like to prioritize.

- We have posted source and binary RPMs for several distributions here:
  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/cmcantalupo/

- memkind is also avaiable in Fedora package repository (devel, EPEL7):
  https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/memkind/

- Pull requests are welcome.

- White space formatting generally conforms to
  $ astyle --style=linux --indent=spaces=4 -S --max-continuation-indent=80 \
           --max-code-length=80 --break-after-logical --indent-namespaces -z2

- For more information about astyle:

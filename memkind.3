.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.BR memkind_error_message ()
converts an error number
.I err
returned by a member of the memkind
interface to an error message
.I msg
where the maximium size of the message is passed by the
.I size
parameter.

.B "HEAP MANAGMENT:"
.br
The functions described in this section define a heap manager with an
interface modeled on the ISO C standard API's, except that the user
must specify the
.I kind
of memory with the first arguement to each function.  See the
.B KINDS
section below for a full description of the implemented kinds.
.PP
.BR memkind_malloc ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of uninitialized memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer
coercion) for storage of any type of object.  If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_malloc ()
returns  NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_calloc ()
allocates space for
.I nmemb
objects each
.I size
bytes in length in memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The result is identical to calling
.BR memkind_malloc ()
with an argument of
.IR nmemb * size ,
with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly
initialized to zero bytes.
If
.I nmemb
or
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_calloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_realloc ()
changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to
.I size
bytes of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of
the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the contents of the
newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined. Upon success, the
memory referenced by
.I ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated high bandwidth memory is
returned.

.BR Note:
.BR memkind_realloc ()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value
than
.IR "ptr" .

If
.I ptr
is NULL, the
.BR memkind_realloc ()
function behaves identically to
.BR memkind_malloc ()
for the specified size.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
with the same
.I kind
as specified to the call to
.BR memkind_realloc ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of memory of a specified
.I kind
such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_free ()
causes the allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to be made available for future allocations. This pointer
must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was already called before, undefined behavior occurs.
If
.I ptr
is  NULL, no operation is performed.
For all currently supported kinds the value of
.B MEMKIND_DEFAULT
or 0 can be given for the
.IR kind .
In the future there may be kinds introduced that will require that the
.I kind
specified to
.BR memkind_free ()
match the value given when the memory to be freed was allocated.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_kind_for_free ()
sets the parameter
.I kind
to a value appropriate for passing to
.BR memkind_free ()
for the address
.IR ptr .
This method can be used in a case where the
.I kind
is unknown in the context of the call to
.BR memkind_free ().
.sp
.B "ALLOCATOR CALLBACK FUNCTIONS:"
.br
This section describes the memkind interface which is used internally
by the heap manager interface.  For these API's the kind is determined
by the partition index.  This enables the underlying heap manager to
call routines with standard type arguments, and allows the heap
manager implementation to be independent of the the specifics of the
.I memkind_t
implementation.
.PP
.BR memkind_partition_check_available ()
returns 0 if there is support on the system for the kind
associated with the
.I partition
and an error code otherwise.
.PP
.BR memkind_partition_get_mmap_flags ()
sets
.I flags
to the value appropriate for the kind associated with the
.I partition
when calling
.BR mmap (2).
.PP
.BR memkind_partition_mbind ()
is a wrapper around
.BR mbind (2)
that simplifies the interface so that the user specifies the
.I partition
associated with the kind of memory, the start address
.I addr
to be mapped, and the number of bytes
.I len
from that address to be mapped. This call is made after
.BR mmap (2)
by the heap manager on the memory that was mapped.
.sp
.B "KIND MANAGEMENT:"
.br
There are built-in kinds that are always available, and these are enumerated in the
.B KINDS
section.  The user can also create their own kinds of memory.  This
section describes the API's that enable the tracking of the different
kinds of memory and determining their properties.
.PP
.BR memkind_create ()
is used to create a new kind of memory.  It takes as input a pointer
to a vtable called
.I ops
that determines the operations that define the kind of memory.  These
operations can be taken from one of the memkind built-in implementations
defined in the memkind headers, or it can be user implemented.  The requirements
for each operation is defined in the
.B MEMKIND OPERATIONS
section.  See the
.B SEE ALSO
section for the list of memkind header files that implement the built-in
operations: each header has a man page.
.PP
.BR memkind_finalize ()
releases all resources associated with the memkind library including
the resouces used by all of the kinds that were created, but it does
not free memory allocated with the
.B HEAP MANAGEMENT
interface.  This must be the last call to the memkind library before
application termination, but it can be called more than once.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_num_kind ()
sets
.I num_kind
to the number of available kinds of memory.  This accounts for
the built-in static kinds and any dynamically created kinds.
Since there is a one-to-one mapping between partitions and kinds,
this is also the number of partitions.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_partition ()
sets
.I kind
to the memory kind associated with the
.I partition
index which must be in the range [0,
.IR "num_kind" " - 1]"
where num_kind can be retrieved with the
.BR memkind_get_num_kind ()
function.
.PP
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_name ()
sets
.I kind
to the memory kind associated with the
.I name
string specified.  All of the built in kinds have name strings that are the lower-case version of name
given in the
.B KINDS
section (for example: MEMKIND_DEFAULT has
.I name
"memkind_default")
.PP
.BR memkind_get_size ()
sets
.I total
to the number of bytes on the system which can be allocated with the specified
.IR kind ,
and sets
.I free
to the number of unallocated bytes available of memory with the
specified
.IR kind.

.BR Note:
These numbers may be specific to the CPU of the calling
thread if the
.I kind
binds memory to NUMA nodes associated with the CPU.
.PP
.BR memkind_check_available ()
Returns a zero if the specified
.I kind
is available or an error code from the
.B ERRORS
section if it is not.
.sp
.B "MEMKIND OPERATIONS:"
.br
The
.I memkind_ops
structure is a vtable that defines the operations which determine the
kind of memory.  This design pattern is modeled after the "mix-in"
pattern used in the Linux kernel to enable some of the features of an
object oriented language in C.  This section defines the inputs,
outputs and responsiblities of each function pointer enumerated in the
.I memkind_ops
structure.  Each of these methods takes a
.B memkind_t
argument as its first parameter which shall be self referencing.
.PP
.BI "int .create(memkind_t " "kind" ", const struct memkind_ops " "*ops" ", const char " "*name" );
.br
shall instantiate all of the dynamic resources associated with the
.IR kind .
It takes a pointer to the vtable structure
.I ops
which has a function pointer for each of methods defined in this section
of the man page.  If any methods are unnessary to the implementation of
the
.I kind
these function pointers shall be set to
.BR NULL .
The
.I name
string is an input parameter that identifies the kind of memory so
that it can be fetched with the
.BR memkind_get_kind_by_name ()
function.  Typically this method is either a pointer to the function
.BR memkind_default_create ()
defined in
.IR <memkind_default.h> ,
or a function that calls
.BR memkind_default_create ()
before performing other setup.
.PP
.BI "int .destroy(memkind_t " "kind" );
.br
shall free all of the dynamic resources reserved by the
.BR .create ()
method.  If no dynamic resources were explicitly allocated in the
.IR .create ()
method, this pointer can be set to
.BR NULL .
.PP
.BI "void *.malloc(memkind_t " "kind" ", size_t " "size" );
.br

.BR memkind_malloc (),
see description above.
.PP
.BI "void *.calloc(memkind_t " "kind" ", size_t " "num" ", size_t " "size" );

.BR memkind_calloc (),
see description above.
.PP
.BI "int .posix_memalign(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "**memptr" ", size_t " "alignment" ", size_t " "size" );
.br
is the underlying implementation of
.BR memkind_posix_memalign (),
see description above.
.PP

.br
is the underlying implementation of
.BR memkind_realloc (),
see description above.
.PP
.BI "void .free(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "*ptr" );
.br
is the underlying implementation of
.BR memkind_free (),
see description above.
.PP
.BI "int .mbind(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "*ptr" ", size_t " "len" );
.br
wraps the
.BR mbind ()
system call and passes through
the start address
.I ptr
to be mapped, and the number of bytes
.I len
from that address to be mapped.
.PP
.BI "int .get_mmap_flags(memkind_t " "kind" ", int " "*flags" );
.br
sets
.I flags
to a value appropriate for passing to the
.IR mmap ()
system call for the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int .get_mbind_mode(memkind_t " "kind" ", int " "*mode" );
.br
sets
.I mode
to a value appropriate for passing to the
.IR mmap ()
system call for the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int .get_mbind_nodemask(memkind_t " "kind" ", unsigned long " "*nodemask" ", unsigned long " "maxnode" );
.br
sets the
.I nodemask
of length
.I maxnode
bits to a value appropriate for passing to the
.IR mbind ()
system call for the
.IR kind .
.PP
.BI "int .get_arena(memkind_t " "kind" ", unsigned int " "*arena" );
.br
sets
.I arena
to an index appropriate for the
.I kind
and CPU when using the jemalloc arena allocation through the
.BR je_mallocx ()
API.
.PP
.BI "int .get_size(memkind_t " "kind" ", size_t " "*total" ", size_t " "*free" );
.br
is the underlying implementation of
.BR memkind_get_size (),
see description above.
.PP
.BI "int .check_available(memkind_t " "kind" );
.br
returns 0 if the
.I kind
is available on the system, and an error code if not.
.PP
.BI "int .check_alignment(memkind_t " "kind" ", size_t " "alignment" );
.br
returns 0 if the
.I alignment
is appropriate for the
.I kind
and an error code if not.
.PP
.BI "int .check_addr(memkind_t " "kind" ", void " "*addr" );
.br
returns 0 if the
.I addr
can be freed with the specified
.I kind
and an error code otherwise.  If the memory cannot be freed with
.BR je_free (),
then at least one of the instantiated kinds must return 0 to enable
freeing.
.PP
.BI "void .init_once(void);"
.br
is set to NULL for any kind that is not built in.  The method is used
to allocate dynamic resources for built in kinds without requiring and
initialization routine.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_malloc (),
and
.BR memkind_realloc (),
return the pointer to the allocated memory, or NULL if the request fails.
.BR memkind_free ()
and
.BR memkind_error_message ()
do not have return values.
All other memkind API's return 0 upon
success, and an error code defined in the ERRORS section upon failure.
The memkind library avoids setting
.I errno
directly, but calls to underlying libraries and system calls may set
.IR errno .

except the allocation is backed by one gigabyte huge pages.  Note that
.I size
can take on any value, but full gigabyte pages will allocated for each
request, so remainder of the last page will be wasted.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED_GBTLB
Same as
.B MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED
except the allocation is backed by one gigabyte huge pages.  Note that
.I size
can take on any value, but full gigabyte pages will allocated for each
request, so remainder of the last page will be wasted.
.SH "ERRORS"
.TP
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
returns the one of the POSIX standard error codes
.B EINVAL
or
.B ENOMEM
as defined in
.I <errno.h>
if an error occurs (these have positive values).
If the
.I alignment
parameter is not a power of two, or is not a multiple of
.IR "sizoeof(void *)" ,
then
.B EINVAL
is returned.  If there is insufficient memory to satisfy the request then
.B ENOMEM
is returned.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
High bandwidth memory memkind operations.  The ACPICA specification
provides the PMTT table which defines a bandwidth value for each
NUMA node.  This table is used to idenify the set of NUMA nodes
that share the highest bandwidth value.  When the memkind library
is installed the application
.I /usr/sbin/memkind-pmtt
is executed which creates the file identified by the constant
.BR MEMKIND_BANDWIDTH_PATH .
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_check_available ()
returns zero if the PMTT table defines heterogeneous NUMA node
bandwidths.   Returns
.B MEMKIND_UNAVAILABLE
if the PMTT table does not exist, or exists and defines uniform NUMA
node bandwidth values.  The PMTT table can be overridden by the
environment variable
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
as described in the
.BR memkind (3)
man page.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_hugetlb_check_available ()
In addition to checking for high bandwidth memory as is done by
memkind_hbw_check_available (), this also checks for 2MB huge pages as
is done by memkind_hugetlb_check_available_2mb().
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_gbtlb_check_available ()
In addition to checking for high bandwidth memory as is done by
memkind_hbw_check_available (), this also checks for 1GB huge pages as
is done by memkind_hugetlb_check_available_1gb().
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_get_mbind_nodemask ()
sets the
.I nodemask
bit to one that corresponds to the high bandwidth NUMA node that has
the closest NUMA distance to the CPU of the calling process and sets
all other bits up to
.I maxnode
are set to zero.
The
.I nodemask
can be used in conjuction with the
.BR mbind (2)
system call.
.PP
.BR memkind_hbw_all_get_mbind_nodemask ()
sets the
.I nodemask
bits to one that correspond to the all high bandwidth NUMA nodes in
the system, all other bits up to
.I maxnode
are set to zero.
The
.I nodemask
can be used in conjuction with the
.BR mbind (2)
system call.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_BANDWIDTH_PATH
Constant string that contains path to binary file that lists the
bandwidths of all NUMA nodes.  Flat binary file containing
.B NUMA_NUM_NODES
integers of type
.BR int ,
where the value is set to zero for undetermined nodes.

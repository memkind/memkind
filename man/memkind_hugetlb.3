.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The hugetlb memory memkind operations enable memory kinds which use
the Linux hugetlbfs file system.  For more information about the
hugetlbfs see link below.
.br
.IR https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
.PP
.BR memkind_hugetlb_check_available_2mb ()
Check if there are 2MB pages reserved in the default hugetlbfs.  If
the kind implements ops.get_mbind_nodemask(), then only the NUMA nodes
set by the nodemask are checked, otherwise every NUMA node is checked.
.PP
.BR memkind_hugetlb_get_mmap_flags ()
Sets the flags for the
.BR mmap ()
system call such that the hugetlbfs is utilized for allocations.
.PP
.BR memkind_hugetlb_init_once ()
This function initializes MEMKIND_HUGETLB kind and it should not be called more than once.
.BR Note:
.BR memkind_hugetlb_init_once ()
may reserve some extra memory.

\f[B]memtier\f[R] - redirect malloc calls to memkind memory tiering
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]memtier\f[B]\f[R]
runs the given program, redirecting memory allocations to different
memory tiers based on a given policy.
This allows unmodified programs to run following a non-greedy allocation
scheme that avoids a performance cliff when DRAM is exhausted.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-r ratio
Specifies the ratio as a pair of integers separated by a colon, where
the first number gives the relative share of near DRAM to be used while
the second number gives \[lq]far\[rq] memory, be it CXL memory or PMEM.
Eg.
\[lq]1:4\[rq] means that 20% of allocations will use DRAM, 80% PMEM.
If the ratio is not given, it defaults to the relative share of
physically installed memory.
This version of memtier recognizes only two tiers (DRAM and KMEM_DAX).
.TP
-t thresholds
Turns on DYNAMIC_THRESHOLD mode where small allocations are served from
DRAM and large ones from far memory.
The syntax is described in depth in man libmemtier, eg.
-t INIT_VAL=1024,MIN_VAL=512,MAX_VAL=65536 starts with a threshold of
1024, then varies it between 512..65536 attempting to match the
requested ratio.
.TP
-v
Displays settings that are passed to libmemtier.
.TP
-h
Shows a help message then exits.
.SH CEVEATS
.PP
This tool doesn\[cq]t expose all features of libmemtier.
Only DRAM and KMEM_DAX memory is supported, to use FS_DAX you need to
configure the library directly, please refer to its man page.
.PP
Or alternatively, you can switch that memory to KMEM_DAX mode.
For that purpose, please refer to \[lq]man
ndctl-reconfigure-namespace\[rq] and \[lq]man
daxctl-reconfigure-device\[rq].

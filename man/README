# man files

This directory contains manpages for memkind interfaces.

**Important Notes:**
No manual changes should be done in this directory.

All files in this directory are generated from doc files in doc directory (in ../doc/ directory).
This directory exists in the repository solely to avoid requirement of *pandoc*
as a dependency when a user wants to call 'make install' (since it installs manpages too).

To see how manpages are generated, please see "Building and Installing" section in the top-level README.

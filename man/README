# man files

This directory contains manpages for memkind interfaces.

**Important Notes:**
No manual changes should be done in this directory.

All files in this directory are generated from doc files in [doc directory](../doc/).
This directory exists in the repository solely to avoid requirement of *pandoc*
as a dependency when a user wants to call `make install` (since it installs manpages too).

To see how manpages are generated, please see top-level README:
[Building and Installing section](README.md#building-and-installing).

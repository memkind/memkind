\f[B]memkind_fixed\f[R] - memkind operations on user-defined memory.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This is EXPERIMENTAL API.
The functionality and the header file itself can be changed (including
non-backward compatible changes) or removed.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
int memkind_fixed_create(struct memkind *kind, struct memkind_ops *ops, const char *name);
int memkind_fixed_destroy(struct memkind *kind);
void *memkind_fixed_mmap(struct memkind *kind, void *addr, size_t size);
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The fixed memory memkind operations enable memory kinds built on
user-defined memory.
Such memory may have different attributes, depending on how the memory
mapping was created.
.PP
The fixed kinds are most useful when a specific memory characteristics,
e.g.\ numa binding, which are not fully supported by other memkind API,
need to be manipulated.
.PP
The most convenient way to create fixed kinds is to use
\f[C]memkind_create_fixed()\f[R] (see \f[B]memkind\f[R](3)).
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]memkind_fixed_create()\f[B]\f[R]
is an implementation of the memkind \[lq]create\[rq] operation for kinds
that are created on the memory area supplied by the user.
It allocates space for some fixed-kind-specific metadata, then calls
\f[C]memkind_arena_create()\f[R] (see \f[B]memkind_arena\f[R](3))
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]memkind_fixed_destroy()\f[B]\f[R]
is an implementation of the memkind \[lq]destroy\[rq] operation for
kinds that are created on the memory area supplied by the user.
This releases all of the resources allocated by
\f[C]memkind_fixed_create()\f[R], but please note that it does not
de-allocate the underlying memory.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]memkind_fixed_mmap()\f[B]\f[R]
allocates the file system space for a block of \f[I]size\f[R] bytes in
the memory-mapped file associated with given kind.
The \f[I]addr\f[R] hint is ignored.
The return value is the address of mapped memory region or
\f[B]MAP_FAILED\f[R] in the case of an error.

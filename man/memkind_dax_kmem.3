DAX KMEM memory memkind operations.
.PP
.BR memkind_dax_kmem_all_get_mbind_nodemask ()

.I nodemask
bits to one that correspond to the all persistent memory NUMA nodes in
the system. All other bits up to
.I maxnode
are set to zero.
The
.I nodemask
can be used in conjunction with the
.BR mbind (2)
system call.

# **README**

This is utils/docker/README.

Scripts in this directory let run a Docker container in various environments (see Dockerfiles in this directory)
to build, test and optionally measure test coverage of any pull request to memkind project, inside it.

These scripts (and Dockerfiles) are used as part of continuous integration process for this repository.

## Environment variables

* **MEMKIND_HOST_WORKDIR** - Defines the absolute path to memkind project root directory on host environment.
    **This variable must be defined.**

* **CODECOV_TOKEN** - Codecov token for memkind repository to upload the coverage results.

* **TEST_SUITE_NAME** - Name of test suite (possible values are HBW/PMEM/DAX_KMEM).

* **PMEM_HOST_PATH** - PMEM mount device path on host environment (useful for testing PMEM configuration). Default value of **PMEM_HOST_PATH** is
*'/tmp/'*.

* **NDCTL_LIBRARY_VERSION** - ndctl library version.
To fully test MEMKIND_DAX_KMEM, ndctl library version tag must be passed as parameter,
see https://github.com/pmem/ndctl/tags.

* **ENABLE_HWLOC** - install hwloc library.
To fully test MEMKIND_HBW*, MEMKIND_*LOCAL hwloc library (v2.3.0 or later) must be installed.
Setting **ENABLE_HWLOC** to 1 runs the installation of hwloc library v2.3.0.

* **TBB_LIBRARY_VERSION** - Intel Threading Building Blocks library version.
For testing Threading Building Blocks, TBB library version tag must be passed as parameter,
see https://github.com/01org/tbb/tags.

* **HOG_MEMORY** - Controls behavior of memkind with regards to returning memory to underlying OS. Setting **HOG_MEMORY** to 1 causes
memkind to not release memory to OS in anticipation of memory reuse soon. For PMEM memory will be released only after calling memkind_destroy_kind()

* **QEMU_TEST** - Setting **QEMU_TEST** results in the execution of tests designated for the QEMU environment.

## Files

*'docker_run_build.sh'*  is used to build of memkind.

*'docker_run_coverage.sh'*  is used for uploading coverage report on [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)

*'docker_run_test.sh'*  is used to run tests of memkind.

*'docker_install_hwloc.sh'*  is used to install hwloc library.

*'docker_install_libvirt.sh'*  is used to install libvirt library.

*'docker_install_ndctl.sh'*  is used to install ndctl library.

*'docker_install_qemu.sh'*  is used to install QEMU library.

*'docker_install_tbb.sh'*  is used to install Intel Threading Building Blocks library.

*'set_host_configuration.sh'*  is used to set hugepages configuration on host machine.

## Building and running the container

One can use the script *run_local.sh* just to build and run tests, e.g.:

```sh
$ ./run_local.sh Dockerfile.ubuntu-20.04
```

**Note:**

Others class group must have write permission to *MEMKIND_HOST_WORKDIR* to use the *run_local.sh* script.

### Building docker images manually

Images built out of Dockerfiles ("recipes") found in this directory may by used with `docker` or `podman` as
development environments.

To build a docker image manually, execute, e.g.:

```sh
docker build --build-arg https_proxy=http://proxy.com:port --build-arg http_proxy=http://proxy.com:port -t memkind:ubuntu -f ./Dockerfile.ubuntu-20.04 .
```

Later, to run such image on local machine, execute, e.g.:

```sh
docker run --network=bridge --shm-size=4G -v /your/workspace/path/:/opt/workspace:z -w /opt/workspace/ -e CC=clang -it memkind:ubuntu /bin/bash
```

To get `strace` working, add to docker run command:

```sh
 --cap-add SYS_PTRACE
```

# NAME #

**libautohbw.so** - An interposer library for redirecting heap allocations

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so command {arguments ...}
```

# DESCRIPTION #

**AutoHBW**  library  (`libautohbw.so`)
:   is an interposer library for redirecting heap allocations (malloc, calloc, realloc, valloc, posix_memalign, memlign) to high-bandwidth (**HBW**) memory. Consequently, **AutoHBW** library can be used to automatically allocate high-bandwidth memory without any modification to source code of an application.

For instance, the following command-line runs existing binary */bin/ls* with **AutoHBW** library, automatically redirecting heap allocations (larger than a given threshold) to high-bandwidth memory.\
`LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so /bin/ls`

## ENVIRONMENT ##

The behavior of **AutoHBW** library is controlled by the following environment variables.

`AUTO_HBW_SIZE=x:[y]`
:   Indicates that any allocation larger than x and smaller than y should be allocated in HBW memory.  x and y can be followed by a K, M, or G to indicate the size in Kilo/Memga/Giga bytes (e.g., 4K, 3M, 2G).

**Examples:**

`AUTO_HBW_SIZE=4K`
:   allocations larger than 4K allocated in **HBW**

`AUTO_HBW_SIZE=1M:5M`
:   allocations between 1M and 5M allocated in **HBW**

`AUTO_HBW_LOG=level`
:   Sets the value of logging (printing) level.  If level is:

+ -1 no messages are printed
+ 0 no allocations messages are printed but INFO messages are printe
+ 1 a log message is printed for each allocation (Default)
+ 2 a log message is printed for each allocation with a backtrace.  Redirect this output and use autohbw_get_src_lines.pl to find source lines for each allocation. Your application must be compiled with -g to see source lines.

**Notes:**

+ Logging adds extra overhead. Therefore, for performance critical runs, logging level should be 0
+ The amount of free memory printed with log messages is only approximate -- e.g. pages that are not touched yet are excluded

**Examples:**

`AUTO_HBW_LOG=1`

`AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=memory_type`
:   Sets  the  type of memory type that should be automatically allocated. By default, this type is **MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED**, if **MCDRAM** is found in your system; otherwise, the default is **MEMKIND_DEFAULT**. The names of memory types are defined in [**memkind**(3)](/memkind/manpages/memkind.3.html) man page. The *memory_type* has to be one of **MEMKIND_DEFAULT**, **MEMKIND_HUGETLB**, **MEMKIND_INTERLEAVE**, **MEMKIND_HBW**, **MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED**, **MEMKIND_HBW_HUGETLB**, **MEMKIND_HBW_PRE‚ÄêFERRED_HUGETLB**, **MEMKIND_HBW_GBTLB (DEPRECATED)**, **MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED_GBTLB (DEPRECATED)**, **MEMKIND_GBTLB (DEPRECATED)**, **MEMKIND_HBW_INTERLEAVE**

If you are requesting any huge TLB pages, please make sure that the requested type is currently enabled in your OS.

**Examples:**

`AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_HBW_PREFERRED`
:   (default, if MCDRAM present)

`AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_DEFAULT`
:   (default, if MCDRAM absent)

`AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_HBW_HUGETLB`

`AUTO_HBW_MEM_TYPE=MEMKIND_HUGETLB`

`AUTO_HBW_DEBUG=0|1|2`
:   Set the debug message printing level. Default is 0. This is mainly for development.

## NOTES ##

It  is possible to temporarily disable/enable automatic HBW allocations by calling `disableAutoHBW()` and `enableAutoHBW()` in source code. To call these routines, please include autohbw_api.h header file and link with -lautohbw.

If high-bandwidth memory is not physically present in your system, the environment variable **MEMKIND_HBW_NODES** must be set to indicate the high-bandwidth node as indicated in [**memkind**(3)](/memkind/manpages/memkind.3.html).

## EXAMPLES ##

The following will run */bin/ls* with **AutoHBW** library. Make sure that paths to both *libautohbw.so* and *libmemkind.so* are included in **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**.

+ `LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so /bin/ls -l`

To run with **MPI**, a shell script must be created, with the correct **LD_PRELOAD** command for each rank. For example, if we put `LD_PRELOAD=libautohbw.so /bin/ls` in a shell script named *autohbw_test.sh*, it can be executed with 2 MPI ranks as:

+ `mpirun -n 2 ./autohbw_test.sh`
